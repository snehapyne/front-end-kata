_After you finish coding, please take 10-15 minutes to briefly describe any usability issues you can identify with the current prototype sketch for this application. Which design decisions do you agree with? Which do you think can be improved? What other ideas or features would be useful to add? While enhancing functionality, how do you plan to manage or improve on the current Enzyme testing suite?_

I feel the UI design of the application can be improved, instead of moving using right and left click, we can keep a drag and drop functionality the way we have on agile boards, so that we can move those tasks as the required stages by dragging instead of right and left click. Or we can have a dual arrow option by clicking on which the items can be moved. The testing suite can be managed accordingly and made precise/optimize as per the design we finalize.
